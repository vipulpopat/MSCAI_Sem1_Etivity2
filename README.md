# Etivity2

Repository for E-tivity 2

## Task 1 (CS5062)
Fill-in the missing values in the bank dataset. Use the EDA techniques from E-tivity 1 to decide how to fill in missing values. In your notebook, explain shortly (max 250 words) the decisions you have taken.

## Task 2 (CS5062)
Decide on the treatment of outliers in the bank data set. If appropriate, remove examples with extreme or unexpected attribute values, apply log transformation to numeric attributes with extreme values. Use other methods, if appropriate, to treat outliers as well. In your notebook, explain shortly (max 250 words) the decisions you have taken.

## Task 3 (CS5062)
Suggest the creation of at least one new feature from the existing ones and justify the usefulness of your choice within the context of the 2-class classification problem you have defined in E-tivity 1.

## Task 4 (CE6002)
Using the dataset you prepared, perform a classification on the data using scikitlearn’s logistic regression.

Generate plots of the approximate probability P[Ein-Eout|>e]. You can use the exact same approach as in E-tivity 1. In the same figure, plot the Hoeffding bound and the VC bound and check whether or not either bound is exceeded (indicate this clearly in a markdown cell).

## Task 5 (CE6002)
Using the dataset, make learning curves for logistic regression and two other machine learning algorithms of your choosing using scikitlearn’s learning_curve functionality. Choose one algorithm with low complexity in terms of VC dimension and one algorithm with high complexity.

Comment on what information you can derive from the learning curves  (in a markdown cell) and how this information differs between simple and complex machine learning algorithms.
