# Task 1 (CS5062)

Fill-in the missing values in the bank dataset. Use the EDA techniques from E-tivity 1 to decide how to fill in missing values. In your notebook, explain shortly (max 250 words) the decisions you have taken.

# Task 2 (CS5062)

Decide on the treatment of outliers in the bank data set. If appropriate, remove examples with extreme or unexpected attribute values, apply log transformation to numeric attributes with extreme values. Use other methods, if appropriate, to treat outliers as well. In your notebook, explain shortly (max 250 words) the decisions you have taken.

# Task 3 (CS5062)

Suggest the creation of at least one new feature from the existing ones and justify the usefulness of your choice within the context of the 2-class classification problem you have defined in E-tivity 1.

# Task 4 (CE6002)

Using the dataset you prepared, perform a classification on the data using scikitlearn’s logistic regression.

Generate plots of the approximate probability P[Ein-Eout|>e]. You can use the exact same approach as in E-tivity 1. In the same figure, plot the Hoeffding bound and the VC bound and check whether or not either bound is exceeded (indicate this clearly in a markdown cell).

# Task 5 (CE6002)

Using the dataset, make learning curves for logistic regression and two other machine learning algorithms of your choosing using scikitlearn’s learning_curve functionality. Choose one algorithm with low complexity in terms of VC dimension and one algorithm with high complexity.

Comment on what information you can derive from the learning curves  (in a markdown cell) and how this information differs between simple and complex machine learning algorithms.

# Post (by Saturday Week 3)

Git push your notebook to the repository for E-tivity 2 and submit a post to the forum for E-tivity 2 with the following content:

Description of how you filled-in or intend to fill-in missing values and how you treated or intend to treat outliers (max 250 words).
Description of any features you have created or intend to create and why (max 250 words).
An analysis of the learning curves you have obtained with the emphasis on explaining how these learning curves inform the theory of generalization.
A justification for the parameters used in the VC bound
A short discussion on whether you think these results prove that learning from data is possible with the logistic regression algorithm
A link to your code in GitLab.

# Respond (by Wednesday Week 4)

Respond to the post of one of your peers on the following aspects:

CS5062

The appropriateness of their data preparation, i.e. filling in missing values, treating outliers and creating new features.
 

CE6002

Any further insights that may be derived from their learning curves.
Their implementation of the learning_curve function.
